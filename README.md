# SQL Insights: Uni-Database Showcase

This project demonstrates my ability in fundamental SQL queries. I initially learned these skills during the 'Datenbanken Grundlagen' lecture at TUM Munich, led by Professor Alfons Kemper. I will use Professor Kemper's University Database, originally in German. I'll translate the table names into English and create a small database using **PostgreSQL 16**. After that, I'll apply the basic SQL queries I've learned

--> Here is a graphic illustrating the Uni-Database in German
